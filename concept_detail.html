    id: "dramatic-irony",
    title: "Dramatic Irony",
    type: "Literary",
    summary: "When the audience knows something the characters do not.",
    description: "Dramatic irony occurs when the audience possesses knowledge that the characters in the story lack, creating tension, humor, or sympathy depending on the genre. It works by aligning the audience with the unfolding of events in a way that the characters cannot anticipate, producing anticipation as the audience waits for the inevitable revelation or outcome. Dramatic irony can deepen emotional investment, since viewers or readers experience both the immediacy of the characters‚Äô ignorance and the weight of foreknowledge.",
    examples: ["Oedipus Rex ‚Äî the prophecy fulfilled long before Oedipus realizes it", "Romeo and Juliet ‚Äî the audience knows Juliet is alive while Romeo believes otherwise"],
    tags: ["irony", "audience", "tension", "anticipation"]
  },
  {
    id: "chekhovs-gun",
    title: "Chekhov‚Äôs Gun",
    type: "Literary",
    summary: "Every element introduced must serve a purpose; if a gun is shown, it must be fired.",
    description: "Chekhov‚Äôs Gun is a principle of narrative economy which states that every element introduced in a story should be necessary and irreplaceable, and anything unnecessary should be removed. The classic phrasing is ‚ÄòIf in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired.‚Äô The idea emphasizes efficiency and coherence, discouraging red herrings or clutter. Writers use it to create expectations in the audience: when an object, detail, or event is highlighted, the audience naturally anticipates it will matter later.",
    examples: ["Chekhov‚Äôs plays, where details were tightly woven into payoff", "Breaking Bad ‚Äî Walt‚Äôs ricin cigarette foreshadowed and later pivotal"],
    tags: ["foreshadowing", "narrative economy", "payoff"]
  },
  {
    id: "deus-ex-machina",
    title: "Deus Ex Machina",
    type: "Literary",
    summary: "A sudden, unexpected solution resolves a seemingly unsolvable problem.",
    description: "Deus Ex Machina (‚Äògod from the machine‚Äô) describes an abrupt, improbable resolution to a conflict, often introduced by an external force or sudden coincidence. Originating in ancient Greek theater, where a god figure would be lowered onto the stage by crane to solve the characters‚Äô problems, it has become a cautionary term. Modern audiences often find it unsatisfying because it undermines narrative tension and character agency. However, it can still be effective when used deliberately for stylistic, ironic, or thematic effect.",
    examples: ["Medea (Euripides) ‚Äî Medea escapes via divine chariot", "Lord of the Flies ‚Äî boys rescued suddenly by a naval officer"],
    tags: ["resolution", "contrived", "external intervention"]
  },
  {
    id: "heros-journey",
    title: "Hero‚Äôs Journey",
    type: "Literary",
    summary: "A narrative pattern where a hero ventures forth, faces trials, and returns transformed.",
    description: "The Hero‚Äôs Journey is a narrative structure identified by Joseph Campbell in The Hero with a Thousand Faces. It maps a common pattern of storytelling across cultures, where a protagonist leaves the familiar world, undergoes trials, receives aid, faces a climactic ordeal, and returns transformed. Its strength lies in its universality: the stages resonate with myth, legend, and modern storytelling alike. Writers use the Hero‚Äôs Journey as both a guide and a tool for subversion, shaping how audiences expect stories of growth and adventure to unfold.",
    examples: ["The Odyssey ‚Äî Odysseus‚Äôs perilous trials before returning home", "Star Wars: A New Hope ‚Äî Luke Skywalker‚Äôs transformation from farm boy to hero"],
    tags: ["archetype", "myth", "adventure", "transformation"]
  },
  {
    id: "tragic-flaw",
    title: "Tragic Flaw (Hamartia)",
    type: "Literary",
    summary: "A character‚Äôs fatal flaw that leads to their downfall.",
    description: "Hamartia, often translated as ‚Äòtragic flaw,‚Äô refers to the personal error or inherent weakness in a character that leads to their downfall. It is not always a simple vice but can also be an excess of a virtue (such as ambition, pride, or indecision). The concept originates in Aristotle‚Äôs Poetics, where tragedy evokes pity and fear precisely because the hero‚Äôs demise stems from a flaw that feels deeply human. This principle highlights the fragility of human greatness and how small imperfections can lead to catastrophic consequences.",
    examples: ["Hamlet ‚Äî indecision delays action and leads to ruin", "Macbeth ‚Äî ambition drives him to tyranny and downfall"],
    tags: ["tragedy", "flaw", "downfall", "humanity"]
  },
  {
    id: "catharsis",
    title: "Catharsis",
    type: "Literary",
    summary: "An emotional release experienced by the audience through drama.",
    description: "Catharsis is the emotional cleansing or purging that audiences experience when engaging with powerful works of art, especially tragedy. Rooted in Aristotle‚Äôs theory, catharsis explains how witnessing fear, pity, or sorrow on stage allows the audience to process and release these emotions in a safe and structured way. It is one of the reasons tragedy has endured across centuries: through the downfall of great figures, viewers are moved to self-reflection and find a release of emotional tension.",
    examples: ["Greek tragedies ‚Äî audiences weep for doomed heroes", "Schindler‚Äôs List ‚Äî evokes catharsis by confronting human suffering"],
    tags: ["emotion", "release", "tragedy"]
  },
  {
    id: "unreliable-narrator",
    title: "Unreliable Narrator",
    type: "Literary",
    summary: "A narrator whose credibility is compromised, leaving truth uncertain.",
    description: "The unreliable narrator is a storytelling device in which the person telling the story cannot be fully trusted. Their unreliability may stem from bias, limited knowledge, deception, or psychological instability. This forces the audience to question what is real and piece together the truth from contradictory or misleading accounts. By creating ambiguity, the device heightens engagement and often mirrors the complexity of truth and perspective in human life.",
    examples: ["The Tell-Tale Heart ‚Äî madness distorts the truth", "Fight Club ‚Äî concealment of the narrator‚Äôs fractured identity"],
    tags: ["perspective", "bias", "truth", "ambiguity"]
  },
  {
    id: "foreshadowing",
    title: "Foreshadowing",
    type: "Literary",
    summary: "Hints or clues suggesting events that will happen later in the story.",
    description: "Foreshadowing plants subtle (or overt) hints about future events, shaping audience expectations and creating suspense. It can be symbolic, thematic, or direct, appearing in dialogue, imagery, or repeated motifs. When done skillfully, foreshadowing enriches a narrative‚Äôs cohesion and rewards attentive audiences, while also lending inevitability to later developments. Too heavy-handed foreshadowing, however, risks making outcomes predictable and dull.",
    examples: ["Macbeth ‚Äî witches foretell Macbeth‚Äôs fate", "Harry Potter ‚Äî prophecy foreshadows Voldemort‚Äôs defeat"],
    tags: ["clue", "anticipation", "suspense", "narrative"]
  },
  {
    id: "stream-of-consciousness",
    title: "Stream of Consciousness",
    type: "Literary",
    summary: "A narrative technique presenting a character‚Äôs thoughts as a continuous flow.",
    description: "Stream of consciousness writing attempts to capture the unfiltered flow of a character‚Äôs inner life, blending sensory impressions, fragmented thoughts, and free associations. It abandons strict linearity and often resists conventional grammar, mirroring the complexity of human consciousness. This technique immerses readers in a subjective perspective and reveals characters‚Äô psychology more intimately than traditional narration.",
    examples: ["Ulysses (Joyce) ‚Äî immerses readers in raw thought flow", "Mrs. Dalloway (Woolf) ‚Äî inner lives dominate external plot"],
    tags: ["narration", "psychology", "subjectivity", "style"]
  },
  {
    id: "archetypes",
    title: "Archetypes",
    type: "Literary",
    summary: "Recurring character types, symbols, or motifs across stories and cultures.",
    description: "Archetypes are universal patterns or symbols that recur across literature, myth, and storytelling traditions. They include character roles (the Hero, the Mentor, the Trickster), narrative arcs, and symbolic imagery that resonate across time and culture. Archetypes are powerful because they tap into shared human psychology and cultural memory, creating a sense of familiarity and depth. While often used straightforwardly, they can also be subverted to refresh traditional storytelling.",
    examples: ["The Mentor (Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings)", "The Trickster (Loki, Coyote in myth)"],
    tags: ["pattern", "symbol", "myth", "universal"]
  },
  {
    id: "existentialism",
    title: "Existentialism",
    type: "Philosophical",
    summary: "A philosophy emphasizing individual freedom, choice, and the creation of meaning.",
    description: "Existentialism argues that human beings are not born with inherent purpose or meaning; instead, individuals must define themselves through their actions, choices, and commitments. It often confronts the anxiety of freedom and the burden of responsibility that comes with creating meaning in an indifferent universe. Existentialist thought emphasizes authenticity‚Äîliving true to one‚Äôs chosen values rather than conforming blindly to societal norms. It rejects deterministic views of human life, focusing instead on the lived experience of choice.",
    examples: ["Sartre‚Äôs Being and Nothingness emphasizes radical freedom", "Camus‚Äô The Stranger portrays life‚Äôs absurdity without external meaning"],
    tags: ["freedom", "choice", "authenticity", "meaning"]
  },
  {
    id: "absurdism",
    title: "Absurdism",
    type: "Philosophical",
    summary: "The belief that human beings exist in a purposeless, chaotic universe.",
    description: "Absurdism, closely associated with Albert Camus, highlights the conflict between humanity‚Äôs search for meaning and the silent indifference of the universe. Life is experienced as absurd when human beings demand coherence or purpose but encounter only randomness and inevitability. Camus did not argue for despair but instead proposed embracing the absurd through defiance, freedom, and joy in living. Absurdism encourages resilience in the face of existential contradictions, treating life itself as an act of rebellion.",
    examples: ["Camus‚Äô The Myth of Sisyphus ‚Äî persistence despite futility", "Beckett‚Äôs Waiting for Godot ‚Äî circular, unresolved existence"],
    tags: ["meaninglessness", "existence", "chaos", "defiance"]
  },
  {
    id: "free-will-vs-determinism",
    title: "Free Will vs Determinism",
    type: "Philosophical",
    summary: "The tension between whether humans control their destiny or are bound by external forces.",
    description: "The debate between free will and determinism centers on whether individuals truly make choices or whether all actions are shaped by prior causes, natural laws, or divine will. Determinists argue that every decision can be traced to preceding events, making freedom an illusion, while proponents of free will insist on genuine human agency. This debate cuts across philosophy, theology, science, and law, influencing questions of morality, justice, and responsibility. Many modern thinkers adopt compatibilism, seeking to reconcile human choice with causal structures.",
    examples: ["Greek tragedies ‚Äî fate is inescapable", "Modern neuroscience ‚Äî brain processes complicate choice"],
    tags: ["choice", "fate", "causality", "agency"]
  },
  {
    id: "nihilism",
    title: "Nihilism",
    type: "Philosophical",
    summary: "The rejection of all religious and moral principles, often in the belief that life is meaningless.",
    description: "Nihilism suggests that life lacks inherent meaning, value, or purpose, often rejecting traditional structures such as religion, morality, or truth. It can manifest as existential despair, but also as an opportunity to free oneself from imposed systems of belief. Nietzsche famously warned of nihilism as a cultural condition, a crisis that could lead either to collapse or to the creation of new values. While often portrayed negatively, nihilism also serves as a philosophical challenge: if no meaning is given, how should we live?",
    examples: ["Nietzsche ‚Äî cultural crisis of lost values", "Turgenev‚Äôs Fathers and Sons ‚Äî character rejects moral traditions"],
    tags: ["meaninglessness", "rejection", "morality", "crisis"]
  },
  {
    id: "social-contract",
    title: "The Social Contract",
    type: "Philosophical",
    summary: "The theory that individuals give up some freedoms in exchange for order and protection.",
    description: "The Social Contract refers to a foundational theory in political philosophy that individuals consent, either explicitly or implicitly, to surrender some freedoms in exchange for protection, rights, and social order. Thinkers such as Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau each offered different visions of this contract‚ÄîHobbes emphasized the need for a strong sovereign to avoid chaos, while Rousseau highlighted collective agreement and the general will. The idea remains central to discussions about the legitimacy of government, civil rights, and the balance between authority and liberty.",
    examples: ["Rousseau‚Äôs The Social Contract ‚Äî governance by general will", "Hobbes‚Äô Leviathan ‚Äî strong authority prevents collapse"],
    tags: ["society", "agreement", "order", "authority"]
  },
  {
    id: "utilitarianism",
    title: "Utilitarianism",
    type: "Philosophical",
    summary: "An ethical theory that actions are right if they benefit the majority.",
    description: "Utilitarianism is a consequentialist ethical framework that judges actions by their outcomes, specifically whether they maximize happiness or well-being for the greatest number of people. Jeremy Bentham emphasized quantifiable pleasure and pain, while John Stuart Mill refined the theory to distinguish higher and lower pleasures, such as intellectual fulfillment over mere physical satisfaction. The approach has been influential in law, politics, and economics, though critics argue it can justify sacrificing individuals for the sake of the majority or overlook principles like justice and rights.",
    examples: ["Bentham‚Äôs calculus of pleasure and pain", "Mill‚Äôs Utilitarianism distinguishes higher from lower pleasures"],
    tags: ["ethics", "consequences", "happiness", "majority"]
  },
  {
    id: "dualism",
    title: "Dualism (Mind/Body)",
    type: "Philosophical",
    summary: "The idea that mind and body are distinct and separable entities.",
    description: "Dualism is the belief that reality is composed of two fundamentally different kinds of substance: the mental and the physical. Ren√© Descartes is most closely associated with this view, positing the mind as immaterial and capable of thought, while the body is material and subject to natural laws. Dualism raises questions about how these realms interact‚Äîhow does an immaterial mind influence a physical body? While challenged by modern neuroscience and materialist philosophies, dualism continues to shape debates in philosophy of mind, religion, and cognitive science.",
    examples: ["Descartes‚Äô Meditations ‚Äî separation of mind and body", "Mind-body problem debated in neuroscience"],
    tags: ["mind", "body", "consciousness", "substance"]
  },
  {
    id: "dialectics",
    title: "Dialectics (Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis)",
    type: "Philosophical",
    summary: "A method of argument involving contradiction and resolution.",
    description: "Dialectics is a method of reasoning and development through contradictions, tensions, and their eventual resolution. Though forms of dialectical thinking date back to Socrates, it was Hegel who formalized it into a system where history and ideas progress through the interaction of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Marx later adapted dialectics to material conditions, proposing dialectical materialism as the driver of social and economic change. The dialectical method highlights that growth often arises not from stability but from conflict, tension, and reconciliation.",
    examples: ["Hegel‚Äôs Phenomenology of Spirit ‚Äî dialectical unfolding of consciousness", "Marxist theory ‚Äî class struggle as dialectical process"],
    tags: ["logic", "conflict", "progress", "resolution"]
  },
  {
    id: "will-to-power",
    title: "Will to Power",
    type: "Philosophical",
    summary: "Nietzsche‚Äôs concept of a fundamental drive within humans to assert and enhance their power.",
    description: "The Will to Power is a concept introduced by Friedrich Nietzsche to describe a primary motivating force underlying human behavior. More than mere survival or reproduction, it is the drive to expand, overcome resistance, and affirm life through strength and creativity. Nietzsche envisioned the Will to Power not just as domination, but as a life-affirming force that can produce art, philosophy, and self-overcoming. It has been both celebrated as a vision of human potential and criticized as a justification for authoritarianism or brute force.",
    examples: ["Nietzsche‚Äôs Thus Spoke Zarathustra develops the idea alongside the √úbermensch", "Influenced later philosophy and psychology"],
    tags: ["power", "drive", "self-assertion", "creativity"]

    id: "the-other",
    title: "The Other (Alterity)",
    type: "Philosophical",
    summary: "The concept of defining identity through contrast with those seen as different.",
    description: "The concept of ‚ÄòThe Other‚Äô explores how identity is formed by contrasting the self against those considered different, alien, or outside. In philosophy, ethics, and postcolonial studies, ‚Äòthe Other‚Äô represents marginalized groups whose existence defines the dominant group‚Äôs sense of self. Thinkers such as Hegel, Levinas, and Simone de Beauvoir explored this dynamic, showing how the Other is essential yet often oppressed. The concept highlights issues of identity, exclusion, and empathy, urging recognition of the Other as a subject rather than an object.",
    examples: ["Simone de Beauvoir‚Äôs The Second Sex ‚Äî woman as ‚Äòthe Other‚Äô", "Postcolonial theory ‚Äî colonized peoples defined as the Other"],

    type: "Philosophical",
    summary: "Art as imitation of life.",
    description: "Mimesis is Aristotle‚Äôs concept that art, particularly tragedy, functions as an imitation of reality. Unlike Plato, who saw imitation as distortion, Aristotle viewed it as a natural human instinct and a way of understanding the world. In literature, mimesis reveals universal truths through characters, actions, and events. It is not a copy of life but a crafted representation that magnifies experience.",

    description: "Anagnorisis is the point in a story where a character makes a critical discovery, often recognizing their own flaw, fate, or true identity. Aristotle saw this as a powerful element of tragedy, tied to reversal of fortune (peripeteia). It heightens dramatic impact by turning ignorance into revelation.",

    description: "Peripeteia is the turning point in a narrative where circumstances shift unexpectedly, often from good to bad. For Aristotle, peripeteia was essential to tragedy because it made the downfall of a protagonist both surprising and inevitable, while still logically connected to their choices.",
